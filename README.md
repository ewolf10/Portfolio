# Background
Soccer is unquestionably the most popular sport across the globe, though the majority of the
world’s population would refer to the game as football. Despite its slow building popularity in the
United States, it is estimated that there are 265 million people that play “the beautiful game” and
viewership of major tournaments and championships is registered in the billions. Considered its
birthplace and almost certainly its current epicenter, football has a uniquely magnetic pull within
the European continent. Home to over 1000 professional club teams playing within 37 leagues,
Europe has the highest grossing individual teams and collective leagues in the world.
Colloquially known as the “Big Five”, they represent the strongest leagues with respect to both
performance and value, and consist of the English Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain),
the Bundesliga (Germany), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France).

Amongst sports fans, it is often said that weather is a great equalizer. Optimal conditions, such
as moderate temperatures, calm winds, and a dry field, allow for a level playing field, so to
speak. Comparatively, in a competition between two mismatched teams, it is thought that suboptimal 
or adverse conditions stand to benefit the lower ranked team. Potentially, this can be
attributed to a disruption of the superior team’s style of play. Perhaps strong winds necessitate
shorter passes and individual possession rather than lofty crosses and free kicks. Fields slick
from rain leads to reduced traction on the ball, leading to a faster paced game. Temperature
extremes could lead to an increase in errors, which are especially evident in defensive statistics.
A team partial to brute force tactics might be at a greater advantage in wet or windy conditions
against a more skill-focused team whose possession is disrupted by the weather. Similarly, it is
possible that offensive minded teams are unable to rally the same explosive energy in
exhaustingly hot or humid conditions.

*Problem Statement*  
The objective of this project was to explore the impact of weather on the results of soccer
matches in the top five European soccer leagues and to show empirically if weather is in fact an
equalizer. First, it identified if weather can be used to predict the outcome of a game.
Specifically, if there is an upset victory (i.e., the lower ranked opponent wins or draws) or if the
result is as expected (higher ranked opponent wins). Second, provided it does have an effect, it
explored if that effect was global or if certain styles of play were affected by weather conditions
differently. By examining the relationship between weather conditions and performance, this
project can help to inform decisions about when and where to play games and could potentially
guide strategies for optimizing performance in different weather conditions.
